# Java-utilities
This repository is to store certain java classes and implementations that require frequently. Creating a library for a single class seems a little too much so I upload the classes here and use them as and when needed. List of classes available are:
<ul>
  <li>Class for reading variable size strings from the serial port using JSSC</li>
</ul>
