# Utilities
This repository is to store certain programs and scripts that are require frequently. Creating a library for a single class seems a little too much so I upload the programs here and use them as and when needed. List of classes available are:
<ul>
  <li> Java - Class for reading variable size strings from the serial port using JSSC</li>
  <li> Python - A simeple program to generate arff formatted dataset with no repetations.</li>
</ul>
